I'm a Computer Science & Cybersecurity student studying at university. 🏫

In my down time, I enjoy tinkering with IoT devices, and connecting them in interesting ways:
- 💡 Smart lights (LIFX/[Nanoleaf](https://github.com/mylesmor/nanoleafapi))
- 🔉 Smart speakers (Sonos)
- 🚗 Car (eventually a Tesla 🤞)
